- **Hook-Based API**\
  Provides a declarative interface for HTTP requests, enabling reactive and composable data fetching.

- **Automatic State Management**\
  Handles `loading`, `data`, and `error` states internally, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistent UI behavior.

- **Request Cancellation**\
  Supports aborting ongoing requests to prevent race conditions and optimize resource usage.

- **Flexible Execution Control**\
  Allows both automatic execution on mount and manual triggering for precise, dependency-driven requests.
